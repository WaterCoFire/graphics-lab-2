This project is based on example code provided in Lab 1 and modified for macOS (Apple Silicon) and Windows 11 compatibility, using MinGW toolchain.

For some noteworthy points in CMake file please refer to the README in Lab 1 project: [https://github.com/WaterCoFire/graphics-lab-1](https://github.com/WaterCoFire/graphics-lab-1?tab=readme-ov-file#graphics-lab-1)

NOTE: The second task in Section 5 (Further exercises) is not implemented in this project because I literally do not have interest at all.
